**Introduction**
Agriculture plays a crucial role in our society, and farmers face the challenge of selecting the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil characteristics, and market demand. To assist farmers in making informed decisions, we have developed a crop prediction model that leverages machine learning algorithms and data analysis.

**Features**
Predicts the most suitable crop based on historical data and environmental parameters.
Provides information on required fertilizers, seeds, and market prices for the recommended crop.
Estimates the potential yield in quintal per acre for the recommended crop.
User-friendly web application for easy input of local parameters and accessing recommendations.
Integration of the model with real-time weather data for accurate predictions.
Dataset
The crop prediction model utilizes the "Crop Recommendation Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on various crops, including their nutrient requirements, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters. The dataset has been preprocessed and prepared for training the machine learning model.

**Dataset Source:** Crop Prediction Dataset

**Technology Used**
Python
Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
Flask (for web application)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)

**Usage**
Enter the required parameters such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and other relevant information.
Click on the "Predict" button to receive the recommended crop along with additional details such as required fertilizers, seeds, market prices, and potential yield.
